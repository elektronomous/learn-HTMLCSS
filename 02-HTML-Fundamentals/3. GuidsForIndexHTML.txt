1# first write the doctype
 ~ the doctype indicate that file is an HTML file.
2# create head and body element
 ~ each of the HTML file always start with this structure.
 ~ head elements is basically for things that are not visible in the browser window.
 3# specify the title of the page on the head element
 ~ the body is for the elements that will visible on the page(browser window).
4# create a first heading inside the body element.
 ~ the <html> element is the parent element of the <head> and <body> element.

~ the purpose of using heading elements is break up big blocks of text into more logical
  sections.
  ~ and basically to add a title to each of the sections.
  ~ the heading elements has hirarchy, which we can use from the biggest(h1),
    to the smallest(h6) heading element.
5# commenting out the 4# and create heading h1, h2, h3 using text inside the content.txt
6# fill each of the sections of heading, with paragraphs using the content.txt
 ~ each and every page should only have one h1 element.
7# create a bold for the author name and italic on 'fundamental' word before 'technologies' word.
 ~ you can use <b> element or <strong> element to make the text bold.
   ~ but you should use the <strong> element because it has a semantic meaning for the text.
 ~ same for the making the text italic, you can use <i> or <em>.
   ~ but you should use the <em> element because it has a semantic meaning for the text

 ~ we can create an order list element using <ol> and <li> which order element is creating a number like 1. 2. 3. 
   and so on.
   ~ you start create an order list using <ol> as the sign that the order begin, and <li> to give the number
 ~ also we can create unorder list element using <ul> and <li> which does the same like the order list but instead
   of number, it create a bullet point.
 ~ ol stands for order list, whereas ul stands for unorder list
 ~ li stands for list item.

8# create an order list for word after '3 parts:'
9# create an unorder list for word after 'Here are 5 of them:'

~ <img> element has no content, and has no closing tag. instead of you add slash inside the <img /> like this.
~ but <img> has we called attributes, attributes are basically piece of data which we can use describe the element
  ~ there are a lot of different attributes for different element. the one of them is
    <img src="/path/to/the/your/image/file">,
    the 'src' attributes which describe the element from which the browser could display the image.
    ~ 'alt' attributes stands for alternative text, it describe what the image is about.
      ~ it helpfull when search engine look for image with its description.
      ~ it also helpfull for screenreader when blind people use an internet.
      ~ when you type wrong image filename, the img element will show the image using the
        the description which you write on alt attributes.
    ~ 'width' attributes will set the image to nWidth pixel
    ~ 'height' attributes will set the image to nHeight pixel

11# specify the language for this HTML using 'lang' attribute inside the HTML element
12# specify the character set for this html document using 'charset' attribute inside meta element
  ~ meta element indicate metadata which is a data about the data
  ~ one of the fundamental building blocks of the internet is a hyperlink/links.
  ~ we can place links into two categories:
    ~ link that point to other pages within our websites.
    ~ link that point to outside of our websites.
    ~ link that point to nowhere, href='#'
  ~ so to create a link element, we use <a> which stands for anchor.
  ~ to make the link to point to another page, you use 'href' attributes
  ~ you can't create a link without href attributes.
  ~ to make the browser to open the link on new tab, you use 'target' attributes
13# create anchor element for words 'MDN Web Docs';
14# create a HTML file called blog.html

  ~ The page we build so far is lacking of structure, because the element appear one after the other.
  ~ we need someway to group them, to divided every section so we can create a structure for the page.
  ~ That's why we need container element to group the element.
  ~ if you look at the 15# you have page navigation right. to make a section for navigation, we use nav
    element
16# create <nav> element to 15#
  ~ may be you wondering, there's no visual change after create the nav element?
  ~ <nav> element will be the invisible box, that contain the element it wrapped. you can style using
    CSS later so you can see the visible change of the <nav> element.
  ~ <nav> element doesn't do anything special, it just group the page navigation.
  ~ There's another container element called <header>, we use this element to group
    top-part of the page or blog-post or another container element, like page navigation and the first <h1> element.
17# group the <h1> and <nav> using <header> element
18# group the top part of the <article> element using <header> element
  ~ now the blog-post is page after the <header> element.
  ~ the common way to group the blog-post is <article> element, another container element.
19# group the blog-post using <article> element
  ~ when we have a bottom-part of a page, like 'Related Post', or link to another article.
    we usually group them using <footer> element.
20# create <footer> element after the <article> element.
