1# first write the doctype
 ~ the doctype indicate that file is an HTML file.
2# create head and body element
 ~ each of the HTML file always start with this structure.
 ~ head elements is basically for things that are not visible in the browser window.
 3# specify the title of the page on the head element
 ~ the body is for the elements that will visible on the page(browser window).
4# create a first heading inside the body element.
 ~ the <html> element is the parent element of the <head> and <body> element.

~ the purpose of using heading elements is break up big blocks of text into more logical
  sections.
  ~ and basically to add a title to each of the sections.
  ~ the heading elements has hirarchy, which we can use from the biggest(h1),
    to the smallest(h6) heading element.
5# commenting out the 4# and create heading h1, h2, h3 using text inside the content.txt
6# fill each of the sections of heading, with paragraphs using the content.txt
 ~ each and every page should only have one h1 element.
7# create a bold for the author name and italic on 'fundamental' word before 'technologies' word.
 ~ you can use <b> element or <strong> element to make the text bold.
   ~ but you should use the <strong> element because it has a semantic meaning for the text.
 ~ same for the making the text italic, you can use <i> or <em>.
   ~ but you should use the <em> element because it has a semantic meaning for the text

 ~ we can create an order list element using <ol> and <li> which order element is creating a number like 1. 2. 3. 
   and so on.
   ~ you start create an order list using <ol> as the sign that the order begin, and <li> to give the number
 ~ also we can create unorder list element using <ul> and <li> which does the same like the order list but instead
   of number, it create a bullet point.
8# create an order list for word after '3 parts:'
9# create an unorder list for word after 'Here are 5 of them:'
