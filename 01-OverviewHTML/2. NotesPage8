~ when we try to access udemy.com for example, it page is always changing because
  there are acitivities like update the videos length, create an account, student
  give new rating, new courses added and more. to make this running, udemy.com need
  something on their system like a database, to keep up to date on their changing data.
~ To execute something on system on a webserver, developers use some kind of back-end
  language Node-JS, PHP, or Python. so what these language do is to take data out of 
  the database and assemble all of the data into files which then sent to the browser
  as the response.
~ those whole process is called back-end web Development
