= The difference between float and absolute position is that all the other element 
  will floating around the element that set the float property.
= When you set the float to be left, Implicityly the left margin of the element that's near the element that has been 
  set to float will become the FINAL_ELEMENT_WIDTH of the element that has been set to float.
  = This set to another value of the float property too.

  
= float could be visually like this:

= After you set the 4# the grey background of the class container will lost 
  its height and still has the background.
  why ? 
  = This because class container has padding still set
  = both h1 and nav is the child element of header element, which are floated.
    = These means that the element would(like) not even be on the page (they're removed).
      And now the element has no content anymore, so that makes the class container has 
      0 height.
