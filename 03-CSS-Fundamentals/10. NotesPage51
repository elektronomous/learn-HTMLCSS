= There's a mix of inline and block elements called inline-block
= This kind of boxes look like inlines from the outside, but they behave
  like block level element in the inside.
  = It occupies only content's space (outside of the element)
  = Causes no line-breaks (outside of the element)
  = We can still set height and width, padding and margins just like on block
    level elements(inside of the elements)

= For some reason, <img> element is inline-box by default.
