~ There are multiple selectors selecting the same element.
  Which one of them applies ?
~ All of them. All rules and properties are applied.
~ If you notice that there are conflicting font-size declaration.
~ Is it 18px, 20px or 22px? => the answer is 20px
~ do you know why ? let's see the rules below
~ CSS Rules start from Highest to Lowest.

HIGHEST -- Declartions marked as !important
        -- Inline style(style attribute in HTML)
        -- ID(#) selector                       => if there are multiple of them? => Last selector will applies
        -- CLASS(.) or PSEUDO-CLASS(:)          => if there are multiple of them? => Last selector will applies
        -- Element selector(p, div, li, etc)    => if there are multiple of them? => Last selector will applies
        -- Universal selector(*)
LOWEST  -- Inherited element style

~ Remember, those all of the style is applied. the rules above is resolving for conflicting
  rules.
~ the !important keyword place inside the value of the property as the last value.
~ the !important keyword is a hack that you can use as a last resort to resolve conflict
  in your CSS.
