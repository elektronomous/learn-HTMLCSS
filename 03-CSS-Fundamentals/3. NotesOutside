= psuedo-class allow us to target different states of an element.
  = for example <a> element has changed to violet after you click its
    content, now its state is changed.
  = using psuedo-class give you to change the behaviour of the state's element.
= when you have a class attribute like this
  
    <p class="paragraphs1 paragraphs2">Hello There</p>
  
  = basically you have 2 class right here and when you style it inside the CSS files,
    you go whether .paragraphs1 or .paragraphs2.

= There are 4 ways to write the selector.
  = list selector       => the style applies to all the selector

      h1, h2, h3 {      /* applies style to h1, h2, h3 */
        ..: ..
      }

  = descendent selector => the style applies to the child element inside the parent element.

      footer p {        /* applies style to <p> element that's inside of all <footer> element */
        ..: ...
      }
  
  = if you see on 18#, the <strong> element by default style its element to font-weight: bold. but when
    we style the parent element(<p> element), the strong element get it style from <p> element.
    = this is called inheritance.
  = inheritance is mechanism by which some styles(some properties) get their values inherited from parent
    elements to child elements.
= we can use <body> element to inherit our styles to child because body element is parent elements.
  = commonly, the inherited style that get applies when using <body> element is the text elements.
  = when you set border for the body element, it set only the border not the child element.
  
  body { 
    color: #444;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }

  = the body selector we create above, doesn't create conflicting selector or all elements applies it style.
    it's pure inheriting the style to the child elements.
= if you want to select all the element, you're using the universal selector. regardless whether the style is
  related to text, or not, the style will applied to all the element.
= If you see the GuidesForIndex which is the command 30# and inspect the element between h3 and p, the margin-top
  between those element is not add up, instead occupying each other.
  = This called collapsing margins.
