~ we can represent color in computer(coding) using RGB model which is
  a combination of RED, GREEN, BLUE.
~ in CSS we have two way in writing color:
  - RGB notation
  - HEXADECIMAL notation
~ RGB notation using rgb function to create the color
    color: rgb(0, 255, 255);    // => blue
    color: rgb(244, 179, 63);   // => orange
~ There's also RGB notation with transparency
    color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3);  // => blue: with transparency of 0.3
~ transparency is also called alpha that's why the function called RGBA.
~ this transparency will be visible if you put the color on top of color
  that's not a white color.
~ the HEXADECIMAL notation use scale from 0 to ff, not like the rgb function.
    color: #00ffff          // => blue
    color: #fbb33f          // => orange
~ the short version of HEXADECIMAL notation is like this:
    color: #00ff          // => blue
~ in real programming, the most use when coloring is HEXADECIMAL notation
  but when you need transparency you use the rgb() function.
