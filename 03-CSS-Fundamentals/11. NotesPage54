= The default position of an element called Normal flow.
= You can also get the Normal flow by set css property:

        position: relative;

= Normal flow means elements are "in flow", The elements are laid
  out according to their order in HTML code.
= There's a position called absolute position which allow us to absolutely position
  element anywhere on the page.
    
        position: absolute;
    
= Set the style to absolute, the element will remove from the normal flow;
  "out of flow"
= This absolute position doesn't impact another element, instead it overlaps 
  another element.
